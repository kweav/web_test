### **About**

This website was created with the OTTR_Template_Website template. This enables simpler creation of websites that have automated checks for broken URLs and spelling errors, as well as automated rendering of all html files. **This change is testing whether or not render will work when a change hits main.** 

I've added the robot as a colaborator too. Not sure why I was getting the actions error I was seeing otherwise. The error was not the bot. I needed to enable actions workflow permissions in settings. `Settings -> Action -> General -> Workflow permissions and choose read and write permissions`

Trying to have the base ottr-preview GHA install docker directly. And trying it again a different way. And again trying another way.

Here is how you can include images in your website pages (this one is saved in `resources/images` to keep things tidy:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Example image", echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/example_image.png")
```
